	<p>
	The Pony Auction takes place the day after the Pony Swim, beginning at 8 am at back of Carnival Grounds.  
	</p>

	<p>
	The auction serves two purposes.  
	</p>

	<p>
	First, the auction helps to control the overall size of the herd, keeping it from growing too large. Each year about 60 foals are born on Assateague Island, VA.  In order 
	to keep the overall herd at a sustainable size, most of the foals are sold at the auction.  A few select foals are designated as 'buybacks'. A buyback pony is auctioned with 
	the stipulation that it will be donated back to the Fire Company and returned to Assateague Island to replenish the herd. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Secondly, the auction is a fundraiser for the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company. The Fire Company uses some of the proceeds from the auction to provide veterinary care for 
	the ponies through out the year.
	</p> 

	<p>
	Auction winners will receive a certificate saying that they purchased a Chincoteague Pony from the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company.

	<h2>
	Tips for those Who plan to bid for a pony during the auction:
	</h2>

	<ul style="text-align:left;">
	<li>
	Be there early if you wish to bid on a pony. The crowds are huge and you will want a space as close to the front as possible.
	</li>
	<li>
	Wear a sun hat and sunscreen. Bring plenty to drink. 
	</li>
	<li>
	A pencil and paper are always useful. A camera is nice. A folding chair is a good idea since the bleachers fill up quickly.
	</li>
	<li>
	You do not have to register for the auction. 
	</li>
	<li>
	If you raise your hand during the auctioneer's chant, you ARE MAKING A BID.
	</li>
	<li>
	Your transportation home for your new foal must be approved by the pony committee. (A horse trailer). 
	</li>
	<li>
	Ponies must be picked up by 5 pm Friday.
	</li>
	<li>
	The only acceptable forms of payment are Visa, Mastercard, and CASH. The Fire Department will not accept checks!
	</li>
	</ul>
