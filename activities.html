			<h2>Biking and Hiking</h2>
			<p>
			Chincoteague offers a great place to take off with a bike or walk. Everything is close and has the perfect blend of small town and wilderness. 
			Many of the roads on Chincoteague have sidewalks. The Chincoteague Bicycling Advisory Committee is taking great strides towards 
			enhancing the recreational experience of  the bicycling public on Chincoteague Island. Hiking and Biking on <a href="assateagueisland.html#trails">Assateague Island</a> 
			offers many views of nature that you would not see anywhere else. There are 15 miles of trails that wind through the marshes and forests and including a path to the 
			Assateague Lighthouse.
			</p>
			<p>
			Chincoteague offers a fantastic, paved nature trail on Hallie Whealton Smith Drive, which is located off of North Main Street, near Chincoteague High School. The 
			<em>Island Nature Trail</em> is located along both sides of Hallie Whealton Smith Drive. The land where the trail is located represents some of last large tracts of 
			undeveloped land on Chincoteague.  The trail is a place where you can see wildlife in its natural habitat and it provides a safe haven for people to walk, run, ride 
			their bike, bird-watch, or just enjoy the natural side of Chincoteague. To the south is an accessible 0.7 mile long paved loop path complete with benches, and an 
			interpretive sign display. Pets are allowed along this portion of the trail.  To the north is a natural surface trail that loops approximately 0.45 miles through 
			pine forest and glade. No pets are allowed on this portion.

			<h2>Boat Tours</h2>
			<p>
			A boat tour is a must do activity for your Chincoteague Island vacation! You will gain a perspective of the area that is not achievable any other way.
			</p>
			<p>
			Most of the tour boat companies offer “Scenic Nature Cruises” that will allow you experience the abundant wildlife and unspoiled nature of Chincoteague 
			and Assateague Islands. Wild Ponies, Dolphins, Bald Eagles, and Sunsets over the Bay are just a few of the highlights you'll have a chance to experience 
			on a Scenic Nature Cruise.
			</p>
			<p>
			A couple of the tour boat companies offer specialized tours, such as a Pirate Ship adventure and hands-on Marine Ecology tour.

			<!-- Crabbing -->
			<hr>
			<h2>Crabbing</h2>
			<p>
			Crabbing on Assateague and Chincoteague  Islands is one of the favorite pastimes for both the local residents and visitors alike. 
			The preferred method for crabbing is with a net and baited line. All of the needed materials can be purchased at any local fishing shop, 
			or hardware store. Most people like to use old pieces of raw chicken, tied to a line with a weight, sitting at the bottom of the water. 
			The crabs will try to catch the bait and are lured into your waiting crab net. Cook the crabs by steaming them in a large crab pot with a 
			generous amount of Old Bay Seasoning, and you can enjoy one of the Eastern Shores most famous delicacy.  The size restrictions and limits 
			in Virginia are enforced as a conservation measure. Crabs must measure 5" from back shell point-to-point.
			</p>
			
			<!-- Clamming -->
			<hr>
			<h2>Clamming</h2>
			<p>
			Clamming is another water pastime that is also plentiful on the Eastern Shore. The favored method is raking while 
			wadding in generally shallow water. The best times being during the low tides. Another way is walking in the sand 
			at low tide and 'signing' them. That means looking for the little keyhole indentations in the sand. By digging just 
			under the surface of the sand, you will find the clams.  Some of the <a href="scenic-cruises.html">Scenic Tour Boats </a>
			offer clamming excursions.

			Chincoteague Island offers several beautiful parks for the enjoyment and recreation of residents and visitors. We highly reccomend taking advantage of these well maintained spaces 
			while your on vacation. 
			</p> 
			<p style="text-align:center;">Robert N. Reed Downtown Waterfront Park</p>
			<p>
			Robert N. Reed Downtown Waterfront Park is located on Main Street in the heart of downtown. The park offers recreational opportunities and many festivals and events are held here.  There are 
			currently 10 boat slips available for rent to transient boats that are in excess of 26’to 50’ in length.  The park is ADA accessible, inclusive of boat slips.  For  
			information about renting a boat slip call the Town Office at 757-336-6519. Be sure to 
			bring your fishing pole and cast your line off the new fishing pier (no license required). <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rQk86C4Y9FB2" target="_blank">Find on Google Maps</a>
			</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;">Veteran's Memorial Park</p>

			recreational fishing license for the water surrounding Chincoteague. The Town of Chincoteague purchases a fishing license for the Veteran's Memorial Park fishing pier, 
			so an individual license is not required.  <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wgcWjep5DfN2" target="_blank">Find on Google Maps</a>
