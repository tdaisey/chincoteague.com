	<h2>Directions</h2>

	<p>
	<b>From the North</b>, after crossing the Delaware Memorial Bridge on I-295, continue on to I-95 (Delaware Turnpike) to exit 4A for Route 1 South 
	(this is much better than taking US 13 direct from I-295). Route 1 is expressway most of the way. Continue to exit 97 which is an expressway connection 
	to Route 13 - turn south. Continue on US 13 to the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Turn left on Route 175 to Chincoteague Island.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>From the South</b>, take Route 13 North and cross the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel from the Norfolk-Virginia Beach area. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge 
	Tunnel connects Route 13 in Virginia Beach to Route 13 on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Turn right on Route 175 to Chincoteague Island.
