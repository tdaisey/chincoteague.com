	<h2>Assateague Lighthouse Climbs</h2>	
	<p>
	The Assateague Island lighthouse was constructed in 1867 and is listed on the Virginia Historic Register. In 2008, restoration of the lighthouse 
	began to preserve this historic treasure. Extensive work was done including repairs to the gallery deck so that visitors can safely enjoy the view 
	from the top of the lighthouse and a new paint job that can be enjoyed while admiring the building from the ground.
	</p>
	<p>
	The lighthouse is open spring-fall, but is closed for the winter months. Days of operation change seasonally. When open, climbs are available 
	9:00am to 12:00pm and 12:30pm to 3:00pm. Lighthouse access is free to the public. 
	</p>

	<h2>Recreational Beach</h2>
	<p>
	Assateague Island offers perhaps the most beautiful beach on the Atlantic Coastline. During the summer season swimmers and sunbathers flock to this white sandy oasis. 
	The beach parking lots fill up fast, so be sure to get there early. A good rule of thumb is to get there before 10am or after 2pm during the peak summer season. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Shell collection is a popular activity for beach goers (limit one gallon per person per day).
	</p>
	<p>	
	Lifeguards are typically on duty from 10:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M daily Memorial Day through Labor Day. The lifeguard protected section of the beach is designated by yellow flags.

	<h2>Over-Sand Vehicle Use</h2>
	<p>
	Two Over-Sand Vehicle (OSV) zones feature miles of unspoiled beach to explore. The South Zone is open for general use. In order to safeguard threatened and endangered species, part of the 
	South OSV zone closes to all access from March 15 – August 31, or until the last nesting shorebird can fly. The North Zone is for fishing only and is open seasonally 
	(March 15 - August 31st). 
	</p>
	<P>
	A four wheel drive vehicle and valid OSV permit are required. OSV permits can be purchased from the Toms Cove Visitor Center. For more information please contact them at (757) 336-6577.

	<h2>Fishing, Crabbing &amp; Clamming</h2>

	you need can be found on Chincoteague Island, at <a href="bait-and-tackle-shops.html" target="_blank">bait and tackle shops</a> or at an

	</p>

	<h2>Wild Pony Viewing</h2>
	<p>
	Wild ponies have inhabited Assateague Island for hundreds of years. These short, stocky Ponies have adapted to their environment over the years by eating 
	dune and marsh grasses and drinking fresh water from ponds. While they appear tame, they are wild, and Park Rangers urge visitors not to feed or pet them.
	</p>
	<p>
	While some suggest that the wild ponies on Assateague Island trace their origin to horses released to forage on the Island by early settlers, the circumstantial 
	evidence suggests that they are indeed the descendants of survivors of ship wrecks in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Assateague Island. 
	</p>
	<p>
	A fence along the Virginia/Maryland State line separates Assateague Island's ponies into two herds. The Maryland herd is owned by the National Park Service. The 
	Virginia herd is owned by the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company. The US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service allows the Fire Company to maintain a herd of approximately 150 
	adult ponies on Assateague Island. About fifty of the adult ponies are fenced into an area just to the south of the main road and can be viewed by the public. The 
	other hundred adult ponies are kept in an area further north. Public viewing of the North herd is limited. Viewing options include hiking up the 7.5 mile Service Road, 	
	take the Refuge Trek tour bus, or take a <a href="" target="_blank">Scenic Tour Boat</a> out of Chincoteague. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The Fire Company controls the herd size with a pony auction on the last Thursday in July. Each year tens of thousands of spectators come to watch the Saltwater Cowboys swim the pony herd from 
	Assateague Island to Chincoteague Island.

	<h2>Boats Tours</h2>
	<p>
	There are multiple boat tours that leave from Chincoteague Island and explore the back bays and marshlands of Assateague Island. Each of these tour boat operations 
	has a Commercial Use Authorization Permit from the National Park Service which allows them to operate their tours within the boundary of the Assateague Island 
	National Seashore. These boat tours a great way to explore the hidden beauty and natural splendor of Assateague Island! They are also one of the best ways to get 
	close to the wild ponies on Assateague Island.

	<h2>Birding/Wildlife Viewing</h2>
	<p>
	Because of its position on the Atlantic Flyway, Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge is an ideal place for birds to rest, feed, nest, or winter. This 
	makes the refuge a great place for bird watching, as well as other species of wildlife and plants.
	</p>
	<p>
	Some of the popular sites to observe wildlife are at Swan Cove Pool along Beach Road. Herons and egrets can be seen in the borrow ditches around the refuge. 
	The Woodland Trail is an excellent place to observe songbirds and Delmarva Fox Squirrels. Snow Goose Pool, in the Wildlife Loop, is a popular spot 
	for many bird species.
	</p>
	<p>
	Visitors may also borrow a pair of binoculars, free of charge, from the refuge visitor center, to help with their birding experience.

	<h2>Horseback Riding</h2>
	<p>
	Horseback riding is allowed along the beach in the South Over Sand Vehicle (OSV) zone. The South OSV zone may be closed due to hazardous conditions or wildlife 
	management practices, and horses will not be permitted in this area during such closures. Horses are not permitted elsewhere on the refuge, including the trails 
	or on Beach Road.
