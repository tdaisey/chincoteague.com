	The weekend prior to Wednesday's Pony Swim, "Saltwater Cowboys" on horseback will begin to round up the approximately 150 adult wild ponies that live on Assateague Island, 
	along with the 60 to 70 foals that were born in the spring.  
	<p>
	<p>
	About 50 adult ponies and their foals live on the southern end of Assateague Island. The Saltwater Cowboys will begin rounding them up into the Southern Corral Saturday afternoon beginning at about 4:30 pm.  
	The Southern Corral is located on Assateague, just off the road that leads to the beach, and is accessible to the public.  The public can view the Ponies in the Southern Corral

	<b>Pony Swim</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	On Wednesday, the Saltwater Cowboys will swim the ponies from Assateague Island to Chincoteague Island. The Ponies will 
	swim across the Assateague Channel and come ashore on the east side of Chincoteague Island.
	</p>
	<img src="chinco-page/images/pony_swim_2.jpg" style="width:100%;padding-bottom:15px;" alt="Chincoteague Ponies Swim the Assateague Channel">
	<p>
	The main public viewing area is Veterans Memorial Park 
	(<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/Elua3" target="_blank">7427 Memorial Park Dr,  Chincoteague Island, VA  23336</a>). A large screen will 
	be located in Veterans Memorial Park with a live feed of the swim.  You will be able to see the swim on the screen. No seating is provided.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Town of Chincoteague provides a free <a href="pony_swim_shuttle.html" target="_blank">Pony Swim Shuttle</a> service, beginning at 4:00 am. The 
	Pony Shuttle runs between various locations on Chincoteague Island and Veterans Memorial Park. This is the best way to get to and from 
	the Pony Swim.
	</p>  
	<p>
	For details about riding the Pony Shuttle, including a printable map of shuttle stops, please <a href="pony_swim_shuttle.html" target="_blank">click here</a>. We recommend 
	getting started early on this day and to anticipate a heavy crowd.
	</p>
	<p>
	All visitors coming in just for the day are encouraged to go to Chincoteague Municipal Center 
	(<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HV1kiiX3ntE2" target="_blank">6155 Community Dr, Chincoteague Island, VA 23336</a>) and catch the free Pony Shuttle. 
	Special needs parking is available at the Chincoteague Municipal Center ONLY.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note that Veterans Memorial Park is not where the Ponies come ashore. The Ponies come ashore at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/S8LbjRoCk2r" 
	target="_blank">Pony Swim Lane</a>, just south of Veterans Memorial Park. If you wish to watch the Ponies come ashore at Pony Swim Lane, 
	please be aware that you will be standing in marshland and space is very limited. No seating is provided.
	</p>
	<p>
	The swim takes place at "slack tide". Slack tide is a period of about 30 minutes between tides, when there is no current.  This is the 
	easiest time for the ponies to make the swim.  The time of slack tide varies each year.  However, the swim generally takes place some time 
	between 7am and 1pm.  The specific time will be announced at the carnival grounds the week of the swim. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The best way to see the pony swim up close is on a <a href="scenic-cruises.html" target="_blank">Charter Boat</a>.  
	However, spots on these boats for the pony swim are in very high demand, so be sure to reserve your spot at least several months in advance.  
	</p>
	<p>
	The first foal to come ashore will be named King or Queen Neptune and will be given away in a raffle drawing at the carnival grounds later in the day (time to be announced).  Tickets are 
	sold each night at the carnival and amongst the crowd while waiting for the swim to occur.  You must have a ticket and you must be present to win. 
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Pony Parade To Carnival Grounds</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	After the swim, the ponies rest for about 45 minutes. Then the Saltwater Cowboys will "parade" the ponies down Main Street, to the carnival grounds where the auction will be held Thursday 
	morning.  The parade route is shown in blue on the map below.

	<hr>
	<h2>Thursday, July 30, 2020</h2>
	<p>
	<b>Pony Auction</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	The purpose of the pony swim on Wednesday is to move the ponies from Assateague Island to Chincoteague Island so that the  foals can be auctioned.  The auction takes place the following 
	day.  The auction serves two purposes.  First, the auction helps to control the overall size of the herd, keeping it from growing too large.  Secondly, the auction is a fundraiser for the 
	Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company. The Fire Company uses some of the proceeds from the auction to provide veterinary care for the ponies through out the year.  
	Auction winners will receive a certificate saying that they purchased a Chincoteague Pony from the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company.
	</p>
	<p>The auction begins at 8 am. The auction is typically very crowded. We suggest you get there early to get a seat.</p>
	<img src="chinco-page/images/pony_auction.jpg" style="width:100%;padding-bottom:15px;" alt="Chincoteague Pony Auction">
	<p>
	Each year the Fire Company designates a select few ponies as "Buy Backs".  A Buy Back Pony is a foal that is designated by the Fire Company to 
	return to Assateague Island to live out its life there.  The Buy Back Pony will be auctioned with the rest of the foals.  The winner of a Buy Back Pony will get to 
	name the Pony before it is returned to Assateague.  Buy Back Ponies replenish the herd on Assateague.  Buy Back Ponies have actually become some of the highest priced 
	ponies sold at the auction. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Proceeds from the sale of one foal annually goes to a regional charity. Past recipients have included Wounded Warriors, Hospice, Palliative Care of the Eastern Shore, and Alzheimer's Adult Care.
	</p>
	<p>
	Each year the Feather Fund helps deserving children purchase ponies at the auction. The Feather Fund is a charity that was created to honor the memory of Carollynn Suplee, a woman who came to 
	Chincoteague annually to help children buy ponies at the auction until she passed away from cancer in 2003. To learn more visit <a href="http://www.featherfund.org" target="_blank">www.featherfund.org</a>.
