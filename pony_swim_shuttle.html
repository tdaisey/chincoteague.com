	<h2>Pony Swim Shuttle Info</h2>

	<p>
	Buses will begin operation at 5:00 a.m. from Chincoteague Municipal Center.  This service is free.
	</p>

	<p>
	All visitors riding the Pony Shuttle will be taken to Veterans Memorial Park.  This is not the pony landing site.  If you wish to go to the landing site, you will need to walk from Veterans Memorial Park.  No seating is provided at either location.  The pony landing site is marshland.
	</p>

	<p>
	A large screen will be located in Veterans Memorial Park with a live feed of the swim.  You will be able to see the swim on the screen.
	</p>

	<p>
	Volunteer Guides are available on some buses to assist you.  Other Pony Shuttle volunteers will be available at various locations to answer questions.
	</p>

	<p>
	Please be prepared for hot and humid conditions on swim day.  Bring plenty of water, sunscreen, and insect repellant.  
	</p>

	<p>
	Special needs parking is available at the Chincoteague Municipal Center ONLY.  The Issuant must be in the vehicle.  There will be a special needs bus to transport to Veterans Memorial Park.  Parking is very limited.  Please see a Pony Shuttle Volunteer for assistance.
	</p>

	<p>
	Day visitors should use Chincoteague Municipal Center.  Turn left at stoplight at foot of bridge.  Proceed to Chincoteague High School and turn right (Hallie Whealton Smith Drive) Continue as directed by Town officials.  There may be some parking available at the Carnival.  Shuttles stop in front of the Carnival to go to the swim and return behind the Carnival. There is no parking at other pick-up points.
	</p>

	<p>
	Please remember where you are parked:  Parking Lot A, B, C, D or Carnival.
	</p>

	<p>
	The shuttles will leave the Municipal Center and pick up in locations along Maddox Blvd and Main Street.  Please look for the Pony Shuttle Stop Sign.  There are no stops south of the Carnival.
	</p>

	<p>
	DECISION!!  Immediately after the swim, two lines will form in the front of Memorial Park (where you were dropped off for the swim).  One line is for transportation to the Carnival (where the ponies are going), and one line is for transportation to the Municipal Center, Motels and other locations.  If you are going to a motel, you will first be transported to the Municipal Center where connections may be made to your lodging.
	</p>

	<p>
	You must be in line to get shuttle transportation at Memorial Park. Please be patient after the swim!  In several hours before the swim we transport thousands.  We cannot accommodate thousands immediately after the swim.  If you paid to park in the Memorial Park area, you will need to walk back to your car as no after swim site empty (approximately 1 hour after swim) stops at the park.  
	</p>

	<p>
	Walking from the swim site to the Carnival after the swim is recommended.  The distance is approximately 1/2 mile.
	</p>

	<p>
	If you walk from Memorial Park to the pony landing site, you must be back to the front of Memorial Park within 30 minutes of the ponies coming ashore.
	</p>

	<p>
	If you take a shuttle to the Carnival, you will not be able to reload on a shuttle until the SWIM SITE (Memorial Park) is empty. 
	</p>

	<p> 
	Buses will begin to load after the ponies arrive at the Carnival.  Service from the Carnival will continue until APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR AFTER THE PONIES ARRIVE. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Vehicle travel will be extremely heavy in the Carnival area and throughout the Island after the swim.  Several of the roads from the swim site to the Carnival will be closed until after the ponies arrive. Please do not attempt to go back to your car then drive to the Carnival.  You will hold up traffic!
	</p>

	<p>
	A long single-file line will form behind the Carnival immediately after the ponies arrive.  The end of the line is to the south of the corral. You must get to the end of the line and work toward the buses.  Be sure everyone in your party is counted for loading.  The line moves quickly as buses become available.
	</p>

	<p>
	After the swim area is cleared, buses will only be available behind the carnival grounds on Willow Street.
	</p>

	<p>
	The last bus leaving from behind the carnival on Willow Street will be approximately 1 hour after the ponies arrive at the Carnival.
	</p>

	<p>
	Buses will run on WEDNESDAY ONLY.
	</p>

	<p>
	Please do not carry large coolers, large strollers, yard/porch chairs or large umbrellas on the buses.  Bring only what will fit in your lap.
	</p>

	<p>
	The "<a href="pony-express.html" target="_blank">Pony Express</a>," the Island's Trolley, will begin service across from the main entrance of the Carnival on Main Street at approximately 11 am.  The fare is $0.25 per person.
