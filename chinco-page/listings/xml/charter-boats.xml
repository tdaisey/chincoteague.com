Bay fishing or cruising the bays and coves around Chincoteague Island can make some great lasting memories for you and your family. Captain Matt is dedicated to helping you with these memories. We fish the bays and channels for 
flounder, croakers, blue fish, and many other species. We will also take you on a true back bay cruise. We go places no other cruise boats go to see birds on the flats, Ospreys on their nest, and Eagles. Dolphins can be seen 
feeding and playing. You may also get to walk on a sand bar and get sand in your toes!
