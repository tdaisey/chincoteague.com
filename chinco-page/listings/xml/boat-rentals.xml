<description>
Snug Harbor Marina has a large fleet of boats for rent . Snug Harbor offers Carolina Skiffs, Bentley pontoon boats and 
Old Town canoes and kayaks. Chincoteague Island is one of the most incredible places you will ever visit and if you want 
to get the best experience and see all Chincoteague has to offer, you must be in a boat. The name Chincoteague is an 
Indian name that means beautiful land across the water and the only way to see what the Indians did is tour the islands by 
water, just like the natives.
