<description>
I was born in Deptford Township, New Jersey but have deep Chincoteague roots, through my mother who was born "up the Neck". I consider myself a "Teaguer-hybrid" 
having spent every summer on the Island. After my mom's passing, my partner, Joe Ficchi, and I lived in various vacation homes in the area – first in East Winds, then 
Wishart's Point and finally Corbin Hall. In 2010 we made the big move and became permanent residents of the Eastern Shore and in 2017, after 34 years together, we 
became joyfully married at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in Onancock. I became a licensed realtor in 2014 and began working for Dockside where I have felt welcomed and 
encouraged. I am on the Board of Directors of the Eastern Shore Association of Realtors and am a liaison for the Outreach Committee.  I am proud of the role I play in 
the Warm Hands Warm Hearts, clothes, and food drive in coordination with the annual Chincoteague Homes for the Holiday Home tour.

<description>
I was born and raised in the Bronx, New York.  All it took was a drive across the causeway to make me fall in love with Chincoteague Island and transplant my family of 
three children and husband, Ken, in 1994.  I have never regretted that decision.  In 2005 I got my Real Estate license and joined the Dockside Properties team.  I 
became a partner in 2015.  I am known for my gift of gab, high energy, and attention to detail. I am well equipped to handle all the needs of buyers and sellers.  I 
get very close to my clients; buying and selling a home or business is a very personal experience and I love that about being an agent.  I focus on quality, not 
quantity because I value my client relationships. Take a look at my reviews on various sites to get to know me even better.  In addition to real estate, I am proud of 
my years of Chincoteague community involvement serving on Boards and Committees, with  Relay for Life, the YMCA, Chincoteague Center and don’t miss me selling raffle 
tickets at the CPD Poker Run each September. My favorite activity is spoiling my three grandchildren and my puppy.

<description>
I was born in the Bronx, New York, and my family relocated to Chincoteague in 1994. I was raised on the Island, graduated from Chincoteague High School and received 
my Bachelor's Degree from Virginia Wesleyan College in Norfolk, VA. In 2017, I decided to follow in my mother's footsteps and become a Realtor with the Dockside 
Properties family. Currently, I am a member of the Education Committee and the Community Outreach Committee with the Eastern Shore Association of Realtors. It's been 
about three years since I became a Realtor and I love my profession. I have been able to help buyers find their dream home and to help sellers close a chapter in 
their lives, as well as make every soccer game and cheerleading event!  I am excited to see where this journey continues to take me. My husband Robert Pace and I have 
three children ages 9, 6, and 2. In addition to real estate, I am an owner of Classy Hipsy, Vice President of the CES PTA, and Secretary of the Chincoteague Tennis 
Association. And despite my very busy life, I still make time to keep buyers and sellers up to date with all of their real estate needs.

Our family's first opportunity to visit Chincoteague Island came in the early 1970's. We fell in love with the water, the beaches, the fishing, the wildlife, the 
sunrises, the sunsets, the restaurants, but mainly with the wonderful people. You can go anywhere in the world, but you will be unable to find better people. Visitors 
and new property owners are always welcomed to the community, clubs, and the wonderful churches.  My wife told me years ago that she wanted to live on Chincoteague, 
watch the sunset every day, and go to the beach anytime we wanted. I retired from a career in industrial maintenance and over thirty years as a real estate investor 
(buying, remodeling, renting, managing, and selling well over fifty properties). I enjoyed purchasing, improving, and selling all types of property: land, single-family, 
multi-family, and commercial properties. We love and enjoy all of the Eastern Shore; but when we decided to take early retirement, we knew that Chincoteague was the 
only place for us. After making the move and finishing a few projects, I realized that I missed working in real estate. I now enjoy meeting interesting new people and 
making lifelong friends, while helping make their Eastern Shore real estate dreams come true. If you need experienced help in any real estate transaction, I would love 
the opportunity to help achieve your goals.
