Inn, Assateague Inn, lies across from the mainland on Chincoteague Island.... It's a place where you leave your cares of the world on the 
mainland...and relax and enjoy life on the island. You'll find that Assateague Inn nestled among the loblolly pines and quiet marshlands of 
Chincoteague Island, overlooking a small salt water creek. Your room or suite is an ever-changing panoramic view of creek, marsh, woods and 
wildlife, whether it be summer, fall, winter or Spring....each season holds its own kind of special beauty.
